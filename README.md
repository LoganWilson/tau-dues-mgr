# tau-dues-mgr
dues manager for lambda chi alpha phi phi zeta

this app will update a google sheet, and can be used to send emails for pending dues

TODO in future:
metrics (google charts) of data
reformat/refactor code
easier to update which spreadsheet is used
send texts
make automated phone calls
link to collections
link to 990 tax form (possibly automate filing of form?)


far future:
in-app budget planning
